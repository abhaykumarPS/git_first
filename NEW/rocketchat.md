    other_info: The README details the installation process for Rocket.Chat, listing prerequisites like Node.js, MongoDB, and Meteor. However, Meteor is not supported on ARM64 platforms due to ongoing issues, and alternative solutions have not worked. While the Rocket.Chat repository has an ARM64 [sub-repository](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Embedded.arm64), no releases are available yet.
